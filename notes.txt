about 5:05:50 the 'createdAt' props causes an error "Objects are not valid as a React 
child (found: object with keys {_seconds, _nanoseconds})".
This is because the 'createdAt' field is of type TimeStamp and it returns an object 
of seconds and nanoseconds. React props doesn't allow objects but arrays.
The best workaround is to store your createdAt as a string not a timestamp.

about 5:52:24. After changing the 'styles' object in signup and login to a function 
with a spread operator, you get the following error: "TypeError: color.charAt is 
not a function in C:/â€¦/node_modules/@material-ui/core/styles/colorManipulator.js:148".
My solution is to put all styling objects inside another object (let me call in 'pageStyle') 
leaving out the (palette) 
object, and spread out only that object that does not contain the (palette). 
In App.js, 'theme' will have two style objects (palette and pageStyle). 
You call pageStyle by adding a dot in the spreadoperator.

About 6:15:10. On adding arguments to 'compose' function in store.js, be sure to leave out 
the last agrument. Just stop at the 'applyMiddleware(...middleware)'. Else 
'Redux TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined' error will show up.
The issue is that compose from redux expects all its arguments to be functions.
So when
window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__() 
is evaluated in that environment it returns a boolean.
