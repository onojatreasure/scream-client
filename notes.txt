5:20:06

about 5:05:50 the 'createdAt' props causes an error "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {_seconds, _nanoseconds})".
This is because the 'createdAt' field is of type TimeStamp and it returns an object of seconds and nanoseconds. React props doesn't allow objects but arrays.
The best workaround is to store your createdAt as a string not a timestamp.
